# Data Analysis Journey

I love the way Data visualisation can tell the story in simple ways. I am enjoying every step of the journey. 

Data Analysis is what I am diving now. SQL and Excel are a great tools for data analysis tasks. And then Python helped me to deal with more large datasets. I am excited to work with data analysis projects and developing problem solving analysis and presenting the visualization to tell the story.

Further diving to Python, Tableau, PowerBI is helping enhancing my skills with data Analysis tools.
